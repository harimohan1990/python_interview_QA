* `.loc`: Label-based
* `.iloc`: Index-based

#### 11. Why is Python considered an interpreted language?

* Compiled to bytecode (`.pyc`), then interpreted by PVM
* No machine code compilation

### Python OOPs Interview Questions and Answers

---

#### 1. What is OOPs in Python?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software. Python supports OOP, allowing for modular, reusable, and scalable code.

---

#### 2. What are the four pillars of OOPs?

* **Encapsulation**: Binding data and methods together and restricting access.
* **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts.
* **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing ones.
* **Polymorphism**: Performing a single action in different ways.

---

#### 3. What is a class and an object in Python?

* **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods.
* **Object**: An instance of a class with actual values.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

my_car = Car("Toyota")
```

---

#### 4. How is `__init__` method used?

The `__init__` method is a constructor called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object‚Äôs attributes.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

---

#### 5. What is `self` in Python classes?

`self` represents the instance of the class. It is used to access attributes and methods within the class.

---

#### 6. What is inheritance in Python?

Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent).

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Bark"
```

---

#### 7. Types of inheritance in Python?

* Single
* Multiple
* Multilevel
* Hierarchical
* Hybrid

---

#### 8. What is method overriding?

Defining a method in the child class with the same name as in the parent class to change its behavior.

---

#### 9. What is method overloading?

Python does not support method overloading by default. It can be emulated using default parameters or `*args` and `**kwargs`.

---

#### 10. What is multiple inheritance?

A child class inheriting from more than one parent class.

```python
class A:
    pass
class B:
    pass
class C(A, B):
    pass
```

---

#### 11. What is encapsulation in Python?

Encapsulation is restricting access to methods and variables using access modifiers (public, protected `_`, private `__`).

---

#### 12. How do you implement abstraction?

Using abstract base classes from the `abc` module.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
```

---

#### 13. What are private, protected, and public attributes?

* **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.
* **Protected**: Prefix with `_`, internal use.
* **Private**: Prefix with `__`, inaccessible directly from outside.

---

#### 14. What is a class method and how is it defined?

Class methods use `@classmethod` and take `cls` as the first parameter.

```python
class MyClass:
    count = 0

    @classmethod
    def increment(cls):
        cls.count += 1
```

---

#### 15. What is a static method?

Static methods use `@staticmethod` and do not take `self` or `cls` as arguments.

```python
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y
```

---

#### 16. What are `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod`?

* **@classmethod**: Operates on the class.
* **@staticmethod**: Utility function with no access to class or instance.

---

#### 17. What is the difference between `isinstance()` and `issubclass()`?

* `isinstance(obj, Class)` checks if `obj` is an instance of `Class`.
* `issubclass(Sub, Super)` checks if `Sub` is a subclass of `Super`.

---

#### 18. What is composition vs inheritance?

* **Inheritance**: "is-a" relationship.
* **Composition**: "has-a" relationship; one class contains another.

---

#### 19. What are dunder/magic methods?

Special methods with double underscores like `__str__`, `__len__`, `__add__` used to define behavior of objects.

---

#### 20. What is the purpose of `super()`?

`super()` is used to call the parent class methods.

```python
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("Parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        super().show()
        print("Child")
```
